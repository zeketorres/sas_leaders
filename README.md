SAS Leadership Peer to Peer Certification

# Goal
With this Open repository I hope to centralize the credentials of individuals who are Peers in SAS syntax that are SAS User Group enthusiasts.

# Purpose Overview
I'd like to see "us" define the right leadership qualities of our SASUser peers as they relate to UserGroupLeadership.
The idea is via this Open Git Repository.
What I'm suggesting is that key individuals who are already leaders begin to add, refine, define, revise the criteria we seek in a Leader.
What we'd end up having is a way to centralize our standards and definitions of what qualities make a leader.
So while we individually can go to get a SQL or SAS or Python certificate. That's great and we can add that credential to our LinkedIn page. But - no one is making our "USER GROUP" credentials.  We need to do that for each other. Hence my idea of Peer to Peer credentials.
I believe that using GIT in an OPEN way - allows for that peer or colleague who bestowed a credential to "us" or vouches for a specific skill - it speaks volumes to those interested in seeing if we have the right, consistent skills to be a participant in other groups.
This is just an experiment that I think is viable if we have the right group of individuals initially contributing and helping it grow in relevance. I'm totally ok if it just withers and doesnt go anywhere.


# Participation Goals
This should be an open repository with a Peer to Peer heirarchy of approval of participation and validation of credentials for each other.
The idea is to have our peer group craft the Leadership Categories as well as vouch or validate the individuals who seek their credentials in one or more categories.
