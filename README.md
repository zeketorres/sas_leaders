SAS Leadership Peer to Peer Certification

# Goal
With this Open repository I hope to centralize the credentials of individuals who are Peers in SAS syntax that are SAS User Group enthusiasts.

# Participation Goals
This should be an open repository with a Peer to Peer heirarchy of approval of participation and validation of credentials for each other.
The idea is to have our peer group craft the Leadership Categories as well as vouch or validate the individuals who seek their credentials in one or more categories.

# Operation or Use
You will have been invited by an existing member to this repository.



# Leadership Categories
Each of these categories are ones which this peer group feels are relevant to someone in a SAS User Group Leadership Role.

## Event Planning
